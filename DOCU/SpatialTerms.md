# Spatial Terms (Brain-Storming Level)

## Spatial metric attributes

Base values 
- location
  - position
  - center
- dimensions
  - width
  - height
  - depth
- orientation
  - angle
  
Derived values
- volume
- ...

## Spatial boolean attributes
- immobile
- moving
- equilateral
- long
- thin
- visible
- focused
- tangible? reach radius 0.7+

## Spatial comparison values

- volume: smaller - larger/bigger
- area: smaller - larger/bigger
- length: shorter - longer
- width/depth: taller - wider (narrower?)
- if both are long: thinner, thicker
- height: lower - higher ???
- 

## Spatial relations

### Topology

Adjacency : Nachbarschaft
- left, right, ...
Connectivity : Verbindung
- in : overlapping?
- ? : crossing
- by : touching
- at : meeting
Orientation
- parallel, orthogonal
Directional
- sector? of center?
Visibility
- seenleft, seenright
Proximity
- near, close, far, leftside, ...
Topology
- inside, contains, disjoint
Comparativity --> better with sort?
- larger, longer


| Category | Spatial Relations |
| --- | -----|
| Adjacency | adjacent to, alongside, at the side of, at the right side of, at the left side of, attached to, at the back of, ahead of, against, at the edge of |
| Directional | off, past, toward, down, deep down∗, up∗, away from, along, around, from∗, into, to, across, across from, through, down from |
| Orientation | facing, facing away from, parallel to, perpendicular to |
| Projective | on top of, beneath, beside, behind, left of, right of, under, in front of, below, above, over, in the middle of |
| Proximity | by, close to, near, far from, far away from |
| Topological | connected to, detached from, has as a part, part of, contains, within, at, on, in, with, surrounding, among, consists of, out of, between, inside, outside, touching, meeting |
| Unallocated | beyond, next to, opposite to, among, enclosed by |
