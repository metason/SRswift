# Spatial Terms

## Spatial metric attributes
location
dimensions
orientation

## Spatial boolean attributes
- immobile
- moving
- equilateral
- thin
- visible
- focused
- tangible? reach radius 0.7+

## Spatial comparison values
- volume: smaller - larger/bigger
- area: smaller - larger/bigger
- length: shorter - longer
- width/depth: taller - wider (narrower?)
- if both are thin: thinner, thicker
- height: lower - higher ???
- 

## Spatial relations
Adjacency : Nachbarschaft
- left, right, ...
Connectivity : Verbindung
- overlapping
- crossing
- touching
- meeting
Orientation
- parallel, orthogonal
Directional
- sector? of center?
Projective
- seenleft, seenright
Proximity
- near, close, far, 
Topological
- inside, contains, disjoint
Comparative
- larger, longer
