## Predicate

### Spatial Relation Attributes
- gap
- angle

## Relation

- enhance Testing

## Object

### Spatial Attributes

User-related
- visible
- focused
- tangible // can be grabbed (by hand)

## Relation Inference (Query)

- Inference of spatial conditions
- Range Query: objects within a certain radius or range
  - euclidean distance (radius)
- Region/Sector Query
  - window/sector
- Direction-constrained Query
- Angle-constrained Query

Check:
- https://github.com/slazyk/SINQ
- https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/Kuery

## Spatial Query
- get inspiration: https://github.com/jsonquerylang/jsonquery
- Function: filter(object conditions), pick(relation conditions), sort(object attribute, direction)
  - filter(width > 0.5 AND height < 2.4)
  - pick(ahead AND smaller)
  - pick(leftside(gap < 0.1 AND yaw < 5.0))
  - sort(width)
  - sort(height <)
- Input: [SpatialObject]
- Output: [SpatialObject]
- Pipe: |
- Text query (will be parsed into functions and expressions to be evaluated)
- pick2x(), pick3x(), pickNx()
  
filter(visible AND lifespan < 2.5)
| pick(near AND (left OR right))
| sort(volume)

filter(id == '1234')
| pick(near AND (left OR right))
| filter(volume > 0.5)
| sort(volume >)
| log()

## Object Inference
- create conceptual objects
- wall by wall AND wall on floor : corner 
- user : tangibleArea 
- zone between ?

## Reasoning
- Graph reasoning over saptial relations
- Parse and translate query
  - using functions?
  - currentState
    - input
    - output
  
filter(visible AND lifespan < 2.5) --> filter("visible == true AND lifespan < 2.5")
pick(near AND (left OR right)) --> pick("near AND (left OR right)")

## Tests
- ...



## Spatial Inference TODOs

Spatial Reasoner
- Update and match objects in fact base
- Derive spatial attributes  
- Deduce spatial relations
- Run pipeline
- derive: object attributes (done automatically)
- deduce: type of relations
- produce: new spatial objects (conceptual)
- (halt: stop pipeline and fail)


filter(visible AND volume > 0.5)
| deduce(relation categories) // optional setup to specify/restrict relations to be deduced
| pick(near AND (left OR right))
| sort(age)
| log(left right)


Spatial inference operations: In a 3D scenery find all subjects matching a given spatial relationship with a reference object (search object).

Spatial Reasoning Language: simple text specification of a spatial inference pipeline 
Inference operation: filter, pick, sort, analyse, validate, log, map?
- input - process - output
pipeline: chain of inference ops

Spatial relations: subject - predictae - object

Derive spatial attributes and object-relations 
Inference of spatial conditions

## Long-term Topics

Spatio-temporal Reasoning
- keep time-stamped snapshots
- calculate trends on confidence: pose, dimension, label/class, ...
- estimate movements

Open-Source Repo
- on github
- various, language-specific versions
  - SRswift
  - SRpy
  - SRjs
  - SRunity / SRc#
- Generic docu
- Demo cases

Voice-based Interaction and Language Models
- Speech recognition to interact with spatial scene
- TTS 
- use of LLM
- get rid of hand controllers 
- add actionable:ObjectHandling to SpatialObject
- Instructions / Education case using speech
- Track behavior in space, xAPI

Route Finding
- Voronoi-based Route Graph
- 


## Motivation

Cardinal Direction Relations in 3D --> sectors
higher-level spatial concepts (e.g., objects, agents, places, rooms), not point clouds or polygon meshes
Agents, robots and autonomous systems
High-level representations are required to understand and execute instructions from humans (e.g., bring me the cup of tea I left on the dining room table)
also enable efficient planning (e.g., by allowing planning over compact abstractions rather than dense low-level geometry)
reasoning in real-time to support just-in-time decision-making
mostly concerned with objects and their relations while disregarding the top layers
Part-of assembly graph versus "flat" 3D scene graphs
navigation, capturing moving entities in the environment
metric-semantic mapping
hierarchical map
metric and topological representations in 2D
compute a Voronoi graph from a 2D occupancy grid
project 3D point clouds to 2D maps
Hierarchical 3D Representation: grouping of inside/parts as layers in 3D with relation lines
- calculate aggregation/group bbox
